# Use data() to load your specified dataset or list:
data("bp_jhs")

# To provide an analytical summary statistic, use describe():
describe(bp_jhs)

# describeBy() will give you a report with a basic summary of the statistics according to a grouping variable:
describeBy(bp_jhs ~ Meal_Time,skew=FALSE,ranges=FALSE)
describeBy(bp_jhs ~ Year,skew=FALSE,ranges=FALSE)

# pairs.panels() is a useful descriptive statistic for small data sets. It to displays a scatterplot of matrices,
# with bivariate scatterplots below the diagonal, histograms on the diagonal and Pearson correlation above the diagonal. 
pairs.panels(bp_jhs,bg=c("yellow","blue"), pch=21,stars=TRUE)

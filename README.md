# Quantitative-BioMedicine
In this case study, we aim to provide bioinformaticians with an effective framework for producing statistical reports based on the display plots of R software by reviewing the tools provided in this reliable software space.

First, we examine a data set qualitatively using functions such as "describe", "describeBy" and "pairs.panels", which are available in packages such as "psych" and "psychTools". For a better understanding and familiarity with the functions provided by these libraries, you can refer to the address "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html" and the information there.

# Quantitative-BioMedicine
In this case study, we aim to provide bioinformaticians with an effective framework for producing statistical reports based on the display plots of R software by reviewing the tools provided in this reliable software space.

First, we qualitatively examine a clinical trial dataset published by Harvard Dataverse (see: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EA1SAP) using functions such as "describe", "describeBy", and "pairs.panels" available in packages such as "psych" and "psychTools" (see the Required-packages file for the multiple installation method in R). For a better understanding and familiarity with the functions provided by these libraries, you can refer to the address "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html" and the information there. It is then very easy to produce a report of basic summary descriptive statistics using the "describe()" and "describeBy()" functions, as well as a matrix scatterplot of histograms and correlations using "pairs.panels()".
